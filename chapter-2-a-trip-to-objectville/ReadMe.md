### What's the difference between a class and an object?

—  A class is like a blueprint for an object. It tells the machine how to make an object of that particular type. Each object made from that class can have its own values for the instance variables of that class. For example, you might use the Button class to make dozens of different buttons, and each button might have its own color, size, shape, label, and so on.

—  An object is like one entry in your address book. One analogy for objects is a packet of unused Rolodex cards. Each card has the same blank fields. When you fill out a card you are creating an instance, and the entries you make on that card represent its state. The methods of the class are the things you do to a particular card; getName(), changeName(), setName() could all be methods for class Rolodex. So each card can do the same things, but each card knows things unique to that particular card.

### How do you make an Object?

—  To create an object, you need two classes. One for the type of object you want to use and the other to test your new class. The tester class is where you put the main() method, and in that main() method you create and access objects of your new class type. The tester class is used to try out the methods and variables of your new object class type.

### What are the two uses of main?

—  to test your real class

—  to launch/start your java application
